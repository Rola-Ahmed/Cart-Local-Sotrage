# Cart-Local-Sotrage

##creating a page with the following details:-
   1- Created an array of objects (containing 6 objects) where each object represents a product with the following properties:-
        - product_name (string, ex: "Gold Coin")
        - product_price (string, ex: "112.55")
        - product_image (string, ex: "gold-coin.png")
        - added_to_cart (boolean, ex: false)

  2- Created a page where there are 6 product cards displayed with all their details

  3- Each product card contains name, price, image, add_to_cart button and quick_view button

  4- Create a cart icon in the navbar, which opens a dropdown with added_to_cart products

  5- The cart icon should have an indicator to the number of added_to_cart products

  6- CreateD a quick_view modal which is opened whenever the user clicks on the quick_view button of any product

  7- The quick_view modal has the same details displayed in the product card

  8-  Adding the product to cart or removing it will affect all places where the product is displayed (product card, navbar dropdown, quick_view modal)

  9- If the product is added_to_cart, the "add to cart" button should be converted to "remove from cart"

  10- I am only allowed to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but you can't use jQuery, Bootstrap, Fontawesome (y use icons but  don't attach a whole library of icons), Google Fonts ( just download and use any single font)
